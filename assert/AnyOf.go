// AnyOf is an assertion helper that allows you run AnyOf.Test assertion blocks, that can fail, as lone at least one of them succeeds.
// common usage use-cases:
//   - list of interface, where test order, or the underlying structure's implementation is irrelevant for the behavior.
//   - list of big structures, where not all field value relevant, only a subset, like a structure it wraps under a field.
//   - list of structures with fields that has dynamic state values, which is irrelevant for the given test.
//   - structure that can have various state scenario, and you want to check all of them, and you expect to find one match with the input.
//   - fan out scenario, where you need to check in parallel that at least one of the worker received the event.
