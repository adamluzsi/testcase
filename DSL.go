// Describe creates a new spec scope, where you usually describe a subject.
//
// By convention it is highly advised to create a variable `subject`
// with function that share the return signature of the method you test on a structure,
// and take *testcase.variables as the only input value.
// If your method require input values, you should strictly set those values within a `When`/`And` scope.
// This ensures you have to think trough the possible state-machines paths that are based on the input values.
//
// For functions where 2 value is returned, and the second one is an error,
// in order to avoid repetitive test cases in the `Then` I often define a `onSuccess` variable,
// with a function that takes `testcase#variables` as well and test error return value there with `testcase#variables.T()`.

// NoSideEffect gives a hint to the reader of the current test that during the test execution,
// no side effect outside from the test specification scope is expected to be observable.
// It is important to note that this flag primary meant to represent the side effect possibility
// to the outside of the current testing specification,
// and not about the test specification's subject.
//
// It is safe to state that if the subject of the test specification has no side effect,
// then the test specification must have no side effect as well.
//
// If the subject of the test specification do side effect on an input value,
// then the test specification must have no side effect, as long Let memorization is used.
//
// If the subject of the test specification does mutation on global variables
// such as OS Variable states for the current process,
// then it is likely, that even if the changes by the mutation is restored as part of the test specification,
// the test specification has side effects that would affect other test specification results,
// and, as such, must be executed sequentially.

// HasSideEffect means that after this call things defined that has software side effect during runtime.
// This suggest on its own that execution should be sequential in order to avoid retry tests.
//
// HasSideEffect and NoSideEffect can be used together to describe a given piece of specification properties.
// Using them at the same location makes little sense,
// it was intended to be used in spec helper package where setup function handles what resource should be used in the spec variables.
// This allows flexibility for the developers to use side effect free variant for local development that has quick feedback loop,
// and replace them with the production implementation during CI/CD pipeline which less time critical.
