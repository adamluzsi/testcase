# Arrange Act Assert

A pattern for arranging and formatting code in UnitTest methods:

- Arrange all necessary preconditions and inputs to build a testing context.
- Act with the subject of given testing scope, which can be acting on the object or method under test.
- Assert that the expected results have occurred.
