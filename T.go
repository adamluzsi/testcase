// Defer function defers the execution of a function until the current test case returns.
// Deferred functions are guaranteed to run, regardless of panics during the test case execution.
// Deferred function calls are pushed onto a testcase runtime stack.
// When an function passed to the Defer function, it will be executed as a deferred call in last-in-first-out order.
//
// It is advised to use this inside a testcase.Spec#Let memorization function
// when spec variable defined that has finalizer requirements.
// This allow the specification to ensure the object finalizer requirements to be met,
// without using an testcase.Spec#After where the memorized function would be executed always, regardless of its actual need.
//
// In a practical example, this means that if you have common vars defined with testcase.Spec#Let memorization,
// which needs to be Closed for example, after the test case already run.
// Ensuring such objects Close call in an after block would cause an initialization of the memorized object all the time,
// even in tests where this is not needed.
//
// e.g.:
//	- mock initialization with mock controller, where the mock controller #Finish function must be executed after each test suite.
//	- sql.DB / sql.Tx
//	- basically anything that has the io.Closer interface

// In computer science, an operation, function or expression is said to have a side effect if it modifies some state variable value(s) outside its local environment, that is to say has an observable effect besides returning a value (the main effect) to the invoker of the operation. State data updated "outside" of the operation may be maintained "inside" a stateful object or a wider stateful system within which the operation is performed. Example side effects include modifying a non-local variable, modifying a static local variable, modifying a mutable argument passed by reference, performing I/O or calling other side-effect functions.[1] In the presence of side effects, a program's behaviour may depend on history; that is, the order of evaluation matters. Understanding and debugging a function with side effects requires knowledge about the context and its possible histories.[2][3]
// The degree to which side effects are used depends on the programming paradigm. Imperative programming is commonly used to produce side effects, to update a system's state. By contrast, Declarative programming is commonly used to report on the state of system, without side effects.
// In functional programming, side effects are rarely used. The lack of side effects makes it easier to do formal verifications of a program. Functional languages such as Standard ML, Scheme and Scala do not restrict side effects, but it is customary for programmers to avoid them.[4] The functional language Haskell expresses side effects such as I/O and other stateful computations using monadic actions.[5][6]
// Assembly language programmers must be aware of hidden side effectsâ€”instructions that modify parts of the processor state which are not mentioned in the instruction's mnemonic. A classic example of a hidden side effect is an arithmetic instruction that implicitly modifies condition codes (a hidden side effect) while it explicitly modifies a register (the overt effect). One potential drawback of an instruction set with hidden side effects is that, if many instructions have side effects on a single piece of state, like condition codes, then the logic required to update that state sequentially may become a performance bottleneck. The problem is particularly acute on some processors designed with pipelining (since 1990) or with out-of-order execution. Such a processor may require additional control circuitry to detect hidden side effects and stall the pipeline if the next instruction depends on the results of those effects.
